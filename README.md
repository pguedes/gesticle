# gesticle

i saw someone talking about Rust and i never liked the solutions for swiping on my linux box... so i wrote this thing in a week on Christmas holidays to learn Rust.

since then this is actually what i use for my gestures on linux (both desktop and laptop)... it's not perfect but it's good enough for me to not bother with fixing it more :)

sharing is caring so i'm posting this to github hoping it may help someone else.

## gesticle-gui

there's a gui now... because i wanted to play with gtk-rs... 

![oops no screenshot for you](https://github.com/pguedes/gesticle/blob/master/deb-assets/gesticle-gui-screenshot.png?raw=true "gesticle-gui")

it should make it easy to edit the gesture action configurations
